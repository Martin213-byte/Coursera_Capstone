    "   In my Business Problem I will analyse and compare the clusters of **restaurants** in the center of three different European cities, namely - **Berlin, Bucharest and Sofia**. \n",

    "   As a Bulgarian who lives in Germany for many years, it is interesting to me to compare two cities like **Sofia and Bucharest**, which are still in a transition period after the fall of the Communist regime in East Europe and despite that they are changing and there are already people from different nationalities living there, they are still **not that multicultural cities comparing to Berlin**.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "   I want to analyse whether the **richness of restaurants** with cousines from different countries is **connected with the multiculturality** of a city or whether the natural people's desire to try dishes from all over the world makes the venues of a city multicultural, before the city has become such. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   Additionally, I want to **analyse whether there are any restaurants with traditional national dishes from one of the three countries in the other two capital cities** (Bulgarian restaurants in Berlin/Bucharest, Romanian restaurants in Sofia/Berlin or German restaurants in Sofia/Bucharest). And **where in the city center is the best place for such a restaurants to be opened**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This problem can be of a great use for private entrepreneurs from any of the three countries, who want to open a restaurant with traditional national cuisines in any of the other two countries. It can also help governmental or tourist organisations who want to promote their city and the deversity of restaurants it offers.   "
